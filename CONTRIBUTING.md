# Working in this workspace

Welcome.  This file is for you, the human who just cloned the
template, and for any AI coding agent helping you.

The [README](README.md) is the 30-second quickstart.  This file is
the "now what?" guide: workflows, debugging, where to look up help,
and how to collaborate with an agent without losing your bearings.

If you're an agent: start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), the distilled
rules and commands for editing this workspace.  Skim this file too so
you understand the human's mental model.

## What this workspace is

A ChuMicro project workspace ships as a Git repo you clone (this
template) and edit in place.  Conceptually it has three pieces:

- **`projects/<name>/`**: your applications.  Each project is a
  directory with an `app.py` (defining `def run(): ...`) plus a
  `project_config.toml` for its knobs.  One project, one deployable
  program.
- **`devices.yml`**: your board registry.  One entry per physical
  board you deploy to.  Tool-managed by `add-device` / `rename` /
  `probe`, so comments and key order survive every edit.
- **`run.py`**: the workspace dispatcher.  Every command goes
  through it: `python3 run.py setup`, `python3 run.py deploy`, and
  so on.  `setup` bootstraps a `.venv`; every later command
  re-enters it automatically.

You write code in `projects/`.  The tooling owns deploys, REPL,
firmware flashing, config merging, and the boot shim (the tiny boot
file it installs on the device to call your `run()`).

## Day one: setup

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ChuMicro/ChuMicro-Workspace-Template my-workspace
cd my-workspace
rm -rf .git && git init       # start your own history
python3 run.py setup          # creates .venv, materializes gitignored workspace.yml + secrets.toml + devices.yml, installs chumicro-workspace
```

`setup` is idempotent.  Re-run it any time after pulling template
updates; it won't overwrite anything you've edited, with one
documented exception: in chumicro-dev mode, the `library_sources:`
block of `workspace.yml` is tool-owned and re-synced on every
`setup` (the rest of the file is yours).

If you're co-developing the underlying ChuMicro libraries from a
sibling clone, see the README's "ChuMicro-dev mode" section.

## Day to day: making and shipping projects

A typical session has four moves:

```bash
# 1. Register a board (once per physical board).  Use `bootstrap`
#    if you want a wizard to walk pick-port, probe, and register
#    in one command.
python3 run.py add-device my-board --address /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 --runtime micropython

# 2. Scaffold a new project
python3 run.py new my_sensor    # creates projects/my_sensor/ from projects/_template/

# 3. Edit secrets.toml (wifi credentials) and projects/my_sensor/{app.py, project_config.toml}.

# 4. Deploy, then watch.  --tail deploys, then follows the board's
#    serial output for 30 seconds (pass --tail SECONDS for a
#    different window).
python3 run.py deploy my_sensor --tail
```

(The `--address` above is a macOS-style port path.  Linux boards show
up as `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`, Windows as `COM3`-style names;
`python3 run.py discover` lists what's visible.)

`python3 run.py status` (or the stricter `doctor`) is a useful
between-step sanity check.  It surfaces common mistakes before a
deploy: malformed `workspace.yml` / `secrets.toml`, an `app.py`
missing its `run()` definition, and so on.

With several boards, map which projects deploy where in
`workspace.yml` and drive them together:

```yaml
deploy_targets:
  garage/heater: pico-w-1          # one target can stay terse
  bedroom_sensor: [esp32-a, esp32-b]
```

`python3 run.py deploy <project>` picks the project's first
registered target; `deploy --all-projects` walks the whole mapping.

The shipped `projects/example_sensor/` is the reference project.
It wires `chumicro-wifi` + `chumicro-mqtt` + `chumicro-kvstore`
into a `Runner`.  Copy and tweak rather than starting from scratch.

### Naming projects

Project directory names must be valid Python identifiers: letters,
digits, underscores; no hyphens, no dots, no leading digit.  The
runtime imports `projects.<your-name>.app`, so a hyphen breaks
deploy.  `python3 run.py new` checks this up front and fails fast
with a clear message.

Nested layouts are first-class.  Slash- or dotted-form names land
under a parallel namespace tree:

```bash
python3 run.py new garage/sensors/door_open
python3 run.py new garage.sensors.door_open      # dotted form, same effect
```

Each path segment is validated independently against the same
identifier rules, and intermediate namespace directories
(`projects/garage/`, `projects/garage/sensors/`) are auto-created with
empty `__init__.py` markers.  `python3 run.py projects` shows the tree
(`--flat` switches to one line per project in slash form).

### Scaffolding from an example

Instead of starting from the blank `projects/_template/`, scaffold
from any directory under `examples/`:

```bash
python3 run.py new garage/heater --from examples/wifi_only
```

That copies `examples/wifi_only/`'s tree into
`projects/garage/heater/`.  The example folder itself is read-only
(tool-owned, refreshed on `update`); your edits live under `projects/`.

### Workspace health checks

Two commands surface common pre-deploy mistakes:

```bash
python3 run.py status     # one-line-per-check snapshot
python3 run.py doctor     # stricter: adds Python version + AST scan for run()
```

`status` catches a missing `devices.yml` and parses `workspace.yml` /
`secrets.toml` for shape errors.  `doctor` adds the Python version
check plus a per-project `app.py` scan ("did you forget the
`def run()`?").

`deploy` runs the same fast checks `status` does as a gate.
ERROR-level findings (malformed YAML files) abort before sending bytes
to the device; WARN-level findings (no devices registered) print but
proceed.  Pass `deploy --skip-health-check` when you've already
validated the workspace state externally (CI flows, scripted runs).

### How config flows from your edits to the device

Every project receives a runtime config at boot.  That config is the
deep-merge of two gitignored host-side sources, flattened to dotted
keys (`wifi.ssid`, `mqtt.broker.host`) for the wire:

```
secrets.toml ──────────────────► projects/<name>/project_config.toml
  (gitignored: workspace-wide       (versioned with your project;
   credentials + device defaults     per-project knobs like sample
   in one place)                     period, mqtt topic, sensor pins)

                            ▼
                 deep merge                     (higher-precedence layer wins at any key;
                            │                    lists replace wholesale; dicts recurse)
                            ▼
                 flatten                        (nested tables become dotted keys
                            │                    like "mqtt.broker.host")
                            ▼
                 serialize                      (one compact file on the wire)
                            │
                            ▼
              /runtime_config.msgpack on device
                            │
                            ▼
                     chumicro_config.config     (your app reads it back as a flat dict)
```

Use `python3 run.py dump-config <project>` to print the merged, flat
dict your project would receive without actually deploying.  Handy
when you're debugging which layer a key landed in or whether an
overlay deep-merged the way you expected.

### Quality gate

`python3 run.py preflight` runs `lint` then `test` as a single sanity
gate.  The gates live in two layers:

- **`quality.toml`** (committed, at the workspace root): the policy
  that travels with your repo, so every clone enforces the same bar.

  ```toml
  coverage_threshold = 70      # example override; the shipped default is 85

  [lint]
  enabled = true               # false skips lint entirely
  select = ["E", "F", "I"]     # ruff rule set
  ```

- **`workspace.yml`'s `quality:` block** (gitignored): per-machine
  overrides.  Any key set here wins over `quality.toml`, useful for
  loosening a gate locally without changing the project's policy.

Both `lint` and `test` are also runnable on their own.

`run.py lint` also runs `chumicro-checks`, a small extra rule set
from the chumicro tooling.  The one you might notice is CHU008, which
flags references that belong to the upstream chumicro repo and don't
resolve in a workspace.  See `pyproject.toml`'s
`[tool.chumicro-checks]` block to opt out of rules.

### Library-shaped code: `shared/` vs `libraries/`

Both hold code your projects can import.  Pick by weight:

| Want to ship... | Drop it under | Imports look like | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A 50-line helper your projects share | `shared/foo.py` | `from foo import bar` | No tests, no version, no scaffolding.  See [`shared/README.md`](shared/README.md). |
| A full chumicro-style library you might publish someday | `libraries/<name>/` (via `python3 run.py new --library <name>`) | `import <name>` | Gets `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `pyproject.toml`, `VERSION`.  The folder appears the first time you scaffold one. |
| A third-party package source tree | `packages/<name>/` | `import <name>` | Gitignored drop area.  See [`packages/README.md`](packages/README.md). |

The import-graph search path resolves explicit `library_sources:`
overrides, then `shared/`, then every `libraries/<name>/src/`
(auto-discovered), then `packages/`.  Steps with no folder on disk
skip silently, so a workspace with no `libraries/` pays nothing.

`python3 run.py new --workbench <name>` is the host-only sibling.  It
scaffolds the same shape with a workbench-flavored pyproject (CLI
entry point, no cross-runtime concerns) under `workbench/<name>/`.
Use it for tools you drive from the laptop.

### Device modes: RAM vs flash

Every deploy chooses a mode:

- **Flash mode** (`deploy_mode: flash`, the default): files land on
  the device's flash.  State persists, the device boots standalone,
  deploys are atomic (write-then-rename), and the runtime behavior
  matches a production deploy.  Use it for project deploys, examples,
  and most functional tests.
- **RAM mode** (`deploy_mode: ram`): the device executes from
  host-mounted source.  Fast iteration and no flash wear, but state
  doesn't persist across resets and the runtime profile differs from
  a real deploy (heavier libraries can run out of memory in RAM mode
  where they fit fine in flash).  Best for single-library tests and
  quick scratch experiments.

Choose the mode with the `deploy_mode:` field on a device's entry in
`devices.yml`, or for one run with `deploy <project> --deploy-mode ram`.

> **Auto-switch when libraries declare `requires_flash`.**  Heavier
> libraries declare `[tool.chumicro] requires_flash = true` in their
> `pyproject.toml` (currently mqtt, requests, http_server, and
> websockets).  When you deploy a project that imports one of those
> and the run's mode is `ram`, the deployer auto-switches to flash
> for that run and prints why.  `--force-deploy-mode ram` bypasses
> the auto-switch (rare; for debugging that behavior itself).

## Debugging: when a deploy doesn't work

The deploy tooling classifies most failure modes into a precise
message that points at a fix: mount the CIRCUITPY drive, swap the
cable, install firmware, plug in the right board.  Start with the
message; it usually names the next move.

Common patterns:

| Symptom | Likely cause | First thing to try |
|---|---|---|
| `port not found` / `failed to access` | board unplugged or claimed by another process | `python3 run.py discover` to list what's actually visible |
| permission denied opening the port (Linux) | your user isn't in the serial-port group | `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` (Debian/Ubuntu; the group is `uucp` on Arch), then log out and back in |
| `no firmware detected` | board is in bootloader / fresh-flash state | `python3 run.py install-firmware --method uf2` (or `esptool` on ESP32) |
| `ImportError: no module named ...` on boot | missing library not yet on flash | check the deploy log; the error names the missing module |
| messages stop after first publish | RAM mode against a project that needs persistent state | switch to flash mode (per-device override in `devices.yml`) |
| TLS connection rejected | clock unset, so the cert validity check fails | NTP-sync after wifi connect, or backdate the cert's `notBefore` for development |

The skill files under `.github/skills/` (loaded by your AI agent on
demand) cover each of these in more detail.  When the table's first
move doesn't resolve it, the ChuMicro repository's
[troubleshooting section](https://github.com/ChuMicro/ChuMicro/tree/main/docs/troubleshooting)
has a page per symptom area: board not found, firmware, deploys and
persistence, WiFi, TLS, memory, and per-board quirks.

## Working with an AI agent

The agent's instruction file is [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).  It describes
file ownership rules (so the agent doesn't clobber files `update`
will refresh) and the canonical workflows.

Three patterns that work well:

1. **Bring the agent into a real session, not a planning one.**
   "Help me deploy `my_sensor` to the Pi Pico W and watch the
   output" gets you concrete diagnostics; "design a wifi
   architecture" gets you a whiteboard.

2. **Hand the agent the failure output, not your interpretation.**
   The deploy and REPL transcripts carry precise, classified error
   messages; an agent can usually map them straight to a fix.

3. **Ask the agent to load the right skill.**  When the agent sees a
   file under `.github/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md` whose description
   matches your task, it loads that procedure.  You can also name
   one explicitly: "use the `deploy-and-debug` skill."

The agent can edit files freely under `projects/<your-name>/`,
`shared/`, `workspace.yml` (except the dev-mode `library_sources:`
block, which `setup` re-syncs), and `secrets.toml`.  `devices.yml`
changes go through the device commands (`add-device`, `rename`),
not hand edits.  It should not edit `run.py`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `projects/_template/`,
`examples/`, or anything under `.github/`; those are tool-owned, and
`python3 run.py update` will rewrite them next time you pull.

## Updating the workspace tooling

```bash
python3 run.py update              # pull tool-owned file refreshes from upstream
python3 run.py update --ref v0.5   # pin to a specific template version
```

`update` only touches tool-owned files: `run.py`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `pyproject.toml`, the `projects/_template/`
skeleton, the `examples/` tree, `.github/skills/`, and
`.github/workflows/`.  Your `projects/`, `devices.yml`,
`workspace.yml`, `secrets.toml`, `shared/`, and `packages/` are never
touched.  (AGENTS.md carries the same list for agents; if the two
ever disagree, that's a bug worth reporting.)

## Where to look up help

- **`AGENTS.md`**: concise rules for editing the workspace (file
  ownership, day-to-day commands, gotchas).
- **`.github/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md`**: agent-loadable procedures
  for the most common workflows.  Useful as reference even without
  an agent.
- **`projects/example_sensor/`**: the worked example.  Read it when
  you're not sure how to wire a service into a `Runner`.
- **The chumicro-workspace [hosted docs](https://chumicro.github.io/ChuMicro/workspace/stable/)**:
  reference for the underlying CLI commands and Python API.
- **The chumicro library [hosted docs](https://chumicro.github.io/ChuMicro/)**:
  per-library guides for `chumicro-wifi`, `chumicro-mqtt`, and the rest.
- **Issues**, routed by what broke:
  - Template bug (a shipped file here is wrong): [ChuMicro-Workspace-Template issues](https://github.com/ChuMicro/ChuMicro-Workspace-Template/issues).
  - Tooling bug (`run.py` commands, deploy, REPL, config merging) or
    library bug (`chumicro_wifi`, `chumicro_mqtt`, ...): file it on
    [ChuMicro-Workspace-Template issues](https://github.com/ChuMicro/ChuMicro-Workspace-Template/issues)
    too, naming the tool or library.  The main ChuMicro repository
    isn't public yet, and this tracker is the interim front door for
    everything ChuMicro-side.
  - Your own project's bug: your workspace repo.

## Project rules: quick reference

These match the rules in `AGENTS.md`; called out here for humans too.

- Project names are Python identifiers: no hyphens, no dots, no
  leading digits.
- Credentials live in `secrets.toml` (gitignored, so your wifi
  password and broker auth never reach git).  Per-project
  `project_config.toml` deep-merges on top.
- `devices.yml` is gitignored.  Re-run `add-device` on a fresh
  clone, or copy your local `devices.yml` over by hand.
- On CircuitPython, do NOT add `CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID` to
  `settings.toml`.  `chumicro-wifi` owns the radio, and
  CircuitPython's auto-connect supervisor will fight it.
- Run `python3 run.py test` (forwards to `pytest`) before shipping.
  Tests live under `projects/<name>/tests/` if you want per-project
  coverage.
- For network-attached projects (anything using `chumicro-mqtt` or
  similar), drive the main loop with `runner.run_until(...)`.  It
  ticks, then parks the CPU in `runner.wait(now)` until the next
  event or deadline, which is the right way to idle.  Don't
  hand-roll a bare `while True: runner.tick()` busy-spin (it never
  parks), and don't add `time.sleep_ms()` inside the loop (tick
  latency matters for packet timing).

## When something feels wrong

Sanity-check ladder:

1. Is the workspace itself well-formed?  `python3 run.py status`
   (or `doctor` for the strict version).
2. Is the board actually plugged in?  `python3 run.py discover`.
3. Is the right runtime registered for that port?  `python3 run.py
   devices` to inspect the registry.
4. Is the deploy actually reaching the device?  `python3 run.py
   repl` and look for the boot banner.
5. Is the failure in your code or in the chumicro stack?  Read the
   traceback's first line: `projects/<name>/app.py` is yours;
   anything under `chumicro_*` is the library stack and the fix
   probably belongs upstream (file an issue).  Failed deploys also
   carry a `--- hints ---` block under the traceback when the error
   matches a known pattern (missing config key, library not
   installed).

Welcome aboard.  Have fun.
