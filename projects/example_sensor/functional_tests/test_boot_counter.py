"""On-device acceptance for example_sensor's persistence contract.

Run it by targeting this directory (a plain ``python3 run.py test``
sweep leaves ``functional_tests/`` trees alone)::

    python3 run.py test projects/example_sensor/functional_tests

``chumicro-pytest-device`` ships this file to a registered board and
executes it there — the tests below run on the device, not the host.

What it covers: the boot-counter pattern in ``app.py`` assumes a
value written through ``KVStore`` survives into a *fresh* store
instance — the same code path a reboot takes.  That's a hardware
property (NVM / flash substrate behavior), so it belongs on a real
board rather than mocked on the host.

The test uses its own key and removes it afterwards, so the real
``boot_count`` of a deployed example_sensor is left alone.
